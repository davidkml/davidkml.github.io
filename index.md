title: About Me
---

I am a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at UCLA. My research interests are in statistical and machine learning. Among other things, I am interested in studying new algorithms and infrastructures for improving the efficiency of model training and meeting the growing performance demands of inference when deploying to real-time services and applications. Some specific application areas that interest me include text mining, image processing, and computational genomics.

I completed my undergraduate education at UC Berkeley. I was a researcher at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Joint BioEnergy Institute and an affiliate of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Throughout my studies, I have engaged in work across the boundaries of statistics, engineering, and the natural sciences, and I am happy to have now found home in the field I have come to view as the intersection of all things.

One of my favorite quotes in the field can be found in the classic text, the _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_ by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman. In this text, and additionally, in his essay [_The Legacy of Computer Science_](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/essays/remember.pdf){:target="_blank"}, Professor Sussman wrote:

> “Computer Science” is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology—the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “what is.” Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “how to.”

I write because, in the same spirit, I am interested in connectedness and the notion that at the core of anything we study is a deep connection to all other things.
