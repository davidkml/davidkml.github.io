I am a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at UCLA. My research interests are in statistical and machine learning, especially in areas addressing the diverse space of problems associated with large-scale training and inference. Among other things, I am interested in studying new algorithmic and infrastructural optimization methods to improve the efficiency of model training and meet the growing performance demands of prediction when deployed to real-time services and applications. Some specific application areas that interest me include computational genomics, text mining, and image processing.

Previously, I was an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley. I was a researcher at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Joint BioEnergy Institute and an affiliate of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I am also a voracious learner. I came to study computer science through a circuitous route in statistics, engineering, and the natural sciences, and I am thrilled to have now found home in the field that I view to be at the intersection of all things.

One of my favorite quotes in the field was given by Gerald Jay Sussman in his paper [_The Legacy of Computer Science_](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/essays/remember.pdf){:target="_blank"}, which expands on ideas originally presented in his renowned text, the _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_. It reads:

> “Computer Science” is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology—the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “what is.” Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “how to.”

And decades after its publication, I believe that many of us are finding that this statement is increasingly becoming the truth.

I write because I am enthusiastic about the connectedness of things. It excites me when I get to see problems, ideas, and knowledge from new lenses. As the work of our time becomes progressively interdisciplinary, such opportunities are becoming increasingly common occurrences. For me, it leads to an exciting sense of rediscovery, and this is something I hope to share through my writing.
